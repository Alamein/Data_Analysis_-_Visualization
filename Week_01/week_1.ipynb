    "\n",
    "- **Python Basics: Variables, Data Types, and Operations**\n",
    "  - **Variables**:\n",
    "    - **Definition**: Variables are containers for storing data values. In data analysis, they allow us to store values for reuse or modification.\n",
    "    - **Creating Variables**: How to assign values to variables using the `=` operator, like `age = 30`.\n",
    "    - **Best Practices**: The importance of using clear and descriptive variable names to make code understandable (e.g., `temperature`, `sales_data`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Data Types**:\n",
    "    - **Core Data Types**:\n",
    "      - **Integer (`int`)**: Represents whole numbers, such as `5` or `100`. Useful for counting items or working with index positions.\n",
    "      - **Float (`float`)**: Represents decimal numbers, like `5.0` or `0.75`. Common in calculations requiring precision, such as percentages or averages.\n",
    "      - **String (`str`)**: A sequence of characters, such as \"hello\" or \"Data Science\". Often used for textual data.\n",
    "      - **Boolean (`bool`)**: A binary data type with two values: `True` and `False`. Important for making logical decisions within code.\n",
    "    - **Type Conversion**: How to convert between data types (e.g., changing an integer to a float) using functions like `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`. Type conversion is crucial for compatibility when processing data from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Operations**:\n",
    "    - **Arithmetic Operations**: Covering basic operations such as:\n",
    "      - **Addition (`+`)**, **Subtraction (`-`)**, **Multiplication (`*`)**, **Division (`/`)**\n",
    "      - **Example**: Calculate total cost by adding item prices or find averages by dividing sums by counts.\n",
    "    - **Comparison Operators**:\n",
    "      - Operators like `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.\n",
    "      - **Example**: Checking if `age >= 18` helps in filtering data based on conditions (e.g., finding adults in a dataset).\n",
    "    - **Logical Operators**:\n",
    "      - **and, or, not**: Used for combining multiple conditions.\n",
    "      - **Example**: `age >= 18 and city == 'New York'` filters data for people above 18 in New York, which is useful in data filtering.\n",
