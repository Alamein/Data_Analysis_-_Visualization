# 12-Weeks Data Analysis and Visualization Training

This 12-week Data Analysis and Visualization course is designed to guide participants from fundamental to advanced concepts in data analytics, equipping them with essential skills to analyze, interpret, and present data insights. Using Python and popular data science libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly), participants will learn to manage, transform, and visualize data in a range of practical contexts. This hands-on program is perfect for beginners in data science or professionals looking to enhance their data analytics skills.

Each week builds progressively, covering topics such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, time series analysis, and interactive visualizations. By the end of the course, participants will complete a comprehensive data analysis project, showcasing their skills in data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
