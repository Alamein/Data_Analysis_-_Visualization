    "1. **Introduction to Pandas**\n",
    "   - **Overview of Pandas Library**:\n",
    "     - Pandas is a powerful, open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It is built on top of NumPy and provides flexible, easy-to-use data structures for handling large datasets.\n",
    "     - Pandas offers two primary data structures:\n",
    "       - **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array, similar to a list or column in a table.\n",
    "       - **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different data types, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
    "   - **Why Use Pandas?**:\n",
    "     - Pandas simplifies many data handling and manipulation tasks:\n",
    "       - **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.\n",
    "       - **Data Transformation**: Filter, sort, and reshape data as needed.\n",
    "       - **Data Analysis**: Perform aggregations, group data, and generate basic statistics.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       import pandas as pd\n",
    "       data = pd.Series([10, 20, 30])\n",
    "       print(data)  # Displays the Series\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading Data from CSV**\n",
    "   - **What is a CSV File?**:\n",
    "     - CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are a common format for datasets, where each line represents a row, and each value is separated by a comma. Most datasets are available in CSV format because it’s easy to use and compatible with many software tools.\n",
    "   - **Using `pd.read_csv()` to Load Data**:\n",
    "     - The `pd.read_csv()` function is used to read CSV files into a DataFrame, making it accessible for analysis within Python.\n",
    "     - **Syntax**: `pd.read_csv('file_path')`, where `'file_path'` is the location of the CSV file.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       # Load a CSV file into a DataFrame\n",
    "       df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Common Parameters for `pd.read_csv()`**:\n",
    "     - **`sep`**: Specifies the delimiter if it’s not a comma (e.g., tab-separated files can use `sep='\\t'`).\n",
    "     - **`header`**: Indicates which row to use as the column names (default is the first row).\n",
    "     - **`index_col`**: Sets a column as the index for the DataFrame.\n",
    "     - **Example with Parameters**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', sep=',', header=0, index_col='id')\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Viewing Data**\n",
    "   - **Inspecting the First Few Rows with `head()`**:\n",
    "     - The `head()` method is used to view the first few rows of the DataFrame, allowing for a quick inspection of the data structure, columns, and sample values.\n",
    "     - **Syntax**: `df.head(n)`, where `n` is the number of rows to view (default is 5).\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "       print(df.head())  # Displays the first 5 rows by default\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Checking the Structure with `info()`**:\n",
    "     - The `info()` method provides a summary of the DataFrame, including the number of rows and columns, column names, data types, and any missing values.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       df.info()\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Viewing Columns with `columns` Attribute**:\n",
    "     - Access the `columns` attribute to list all column names, which is helpful for understanding the data and selecting specific columns for analysis.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       print(df.columns)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Checking the Shape of Data with `shape`**:\n",
    "     - The `shape` attribute returns a tuple of the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame, helping gauge the size of the dataset.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       print(df.shape)  # Output: (rows, columns)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Summary Statistics with `describe()`**:\n",
    "     - The `describe()` method generates summary statistics for numerical columns, such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       df.describe()\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Example Workflow for Initial Data Inspection**:\n",
    "     - A common workflow for loading and inspecting data might include:\n",
    "       1. Load the dataset with `pd.read_csv()`.\n",
    "       2. View the first few rows with `head()`.\n",
    "       3. Check the structure with `info()`.\n",
    "       4. Get summary statistics with `describe()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "- **Exercise 1**: Load a sample CSV file into a DataFrame and display the first 5 rows using `head()`.\n",
    "- **Exercise 2**: Use the `info()` method to display the structure of the DataFrame and list all column names with the `columns` attribute.\n",
    "- **Exercise 3**: Use `describe()` to generate summary statistics for a dataset and interpret key values like mean and standard deviation.\n"
