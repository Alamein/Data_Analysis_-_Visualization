    "# Week 5: EDA - Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Learn to compute key statistical summaries and understand data distributions.\n",
    "- Understand how to calculate and interpret correlations in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics\n",
    "- **Mean, Median, Mode**: Measures of central tendency to summarize data.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation and Variance**: Measures of data spread.\n",
    "- **Correlations**: Identifying relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction to Descriptive Statistics**\n",
    "   - Descriptive statistics provide a way to summarize and understand the basic features of a dataset. They include measures of central tendency (like mean, median, and mode) and measures of variability (like standard deviation and variance).\n",
    "   - **Importance of Descriptive Statistics**:\n",
    "     - Summarizes data for a quick overview of main characteristics.\n",
    "     - Helps identify data trends, patterns, and potential anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measures of Central Tendency**\n",
    "   - **Mean (Average)**:\n",
    "     - The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. It gives an overall indication of the data’s central point.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       mean_value = df['column'].mean()\n",
    "       print(mean_value)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Median**:\n",
    "     - The median is the middle value of the dataset when arranged in ascending order. It’s less affected by outliers than the mean.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       median_value = df['column'].median()\n",
    "       print(median_value)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Mode**:\n",
    "     - The mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. It’s useful for categorical data or data with repeated values.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       mode_value = df['column'].mode()\n",
    "       print(mode_value)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measures of Variability**\n",
    "   - **Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "     - Standard deviation (SD) quantifies the amount of variation or spread in a set of values. A higher SD indicates greater data dispersion.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       std_dev = df['column'].std()\n",
    "       print(std_dev)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Variance**:\n",
    "     - Variance measures the average degree to which each point differs from the mean. It is the square of the standard deviation.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       variance = df['column'].var()\n",
    "       print(variance)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Summarizing Descriptive Statistics with `describe()`**\n",
    "   - The `describe()` method provides a summary of all numerical columns, including count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%).\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     summary_stats = df.describe()\n",
    "     print(summary_stats)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Interpreting Results**:\n",
    "     - Use these statistics to understand the general shape and spread of your data, as well as to detect any unusually high or low values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Correlations**\n",
    "   - **Understanding Correlation**:\n",
    "     - Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, often indicating how one variable may change in response to another. Values range from -1 to 1:\n",
    "       - **1**: Perfect positive correlation.\n",
    "       - **0**: No correlation.\n",
    "       - **-1**: Perfect negative correlation.\n",
    "     - **Positive Correlation**: As one variable increases, the other tends to increase.\n",
    "     - **Negative Correlation**: As one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "   - **Calculating Correlation with `corr()`**:\n",
    "     - The `corr()` method computes the correlation matrix for all numerical columns in a DataFrame.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       correlation_matrix = df.corr()\n",
    "       print(correlation_matrix)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Using Heatmaps for Visualization**:\n",
    "     - Visualize correlations with a heatmap, which provides a quick visual representation of relationships between variables.\n",
    "     - **Example**:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       import seaborn as sns\n",
    "       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "       sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\n",
    "       plt.show()\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   - **Interpreting Correlations**:\n",
    "     - Correlation analysis helps identify potential predictors and relationships. For instance, a high positive correlation between two variables may suggest a cause-and-effect relationship or similar underlying factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Practical Workflow for Descriptive Statistics**\n",
    "   - A typical workflow for performing descriptive statistics includes:\n",
    "     1. Calculating measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode).\n",
    "     2. Assessing data spread using standard deviation and variance.\n",
    "     3. Summarizing statistics using `describe()`.\n",
    "     4. Analyzing relationships through correlation coefficients and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "- **Exercise 1**: Compute the mean, median, and mode for a dataset column and interpret each value in context.\n",
    "- **Exercise 2**: Calculate the standard deviation and variance for a numeric column and describe what the results suggest about data spread.\n",
    "- **Exercise 3**: Generate a correlation matrix for the dataset, visualize it using a heatmap, and interpret key relationships between variables.\n"
