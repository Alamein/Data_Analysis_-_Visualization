    "# Week 2: Data Structures in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Understand and work with Python's built-in data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.\n",
    "- Learn how to iterate over and manipulate data in each of these structures, which are foundational for data analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics\n",
    "- **Lists**: Learn about lists as ordered, mutable sequences that can hold different data types, making them versatile for storing data.\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: Understand dictionaries as key-value pairs that allow fast data lookup, making them ideal for structured data.\n",
    "- **Sets**: Explore sets as collections of unique elements, useful for removing duplicates and performing mathematical set operations.\n",
    "- **Tuples**: Learn about tuples as immutable sequences that are useful for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or constant data.\n",
    "- **Iterating and Manipulating Data**: Practice accessing, modifying, and iterating over elements in each data structure to build data handling skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction to Data Structures**\n",
    "   - Python provides several built-in data structures, each suited for different types of data handling tasks. Mastering these data structures enables efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, which is crucial for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lists**\n",
    "   - **Definition and Properties**:\n",
    "     - A list in Python is an ordered, mutable collection that can hold elements of various data types (e.g., integers, strings, other lists).\n",
    "     - Lists are created using square brackets, e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'hello']`.\n",
    "   - **Common Operations**:\n",
    "     - **Accessing Elements**: Access elements by index (e.g., `my_list[0]` for the first item).\n",
    "     - **Adding Elements**: Append new items with `append()` or extend lists with another list using `extend()`.\n",
    "     - **Removing Elements**: Use `remove()` to delete by value or `pop()` to delete by index.\n",
    "     - **Slicing**: Access a subset of the list with slicing (e.g., `my_list[1:3]`).\n",
    "   - **Applications**:\n",
    "     - Lists are versatile and often used for data analysis tasks, like storing records or holding results from calculations.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     data = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
    "     data.append(25)  # Adds 25 to the end of the list\n",
    "     data[0] = 0  # Changes the first item to 0\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dictionaries**\n",
    "   - **Definition and Properties**:\n",
    "     - A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, created using curly braces, e.g., `person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}`.\n",
    "     - Keys are unique and act as identifiers, while values store data associated with each key.\n",
    "   - **Common Operations**:\n",
    "     - **Accessing Values**: Use the key to retrieve a value (e.g., `person['name']`).\n",
    "     - **Adding/Updating Values**: Assign a new key-value pair or update an existing one (e.g., `person['city'] = 'New York'`).\n",
    "     - **Removing Items**: Use `pop()` to remove a key-value pair.\n",
    "   - **Applications**:\n",
    "     - Dictionaries are ideal for structured data like JSON and are often used for fast data lookups, such as mapping IDs to names.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     employee = {'name': 'John', 'role': 'Engineer'}\n",
    "     employee['salary'] = 70000  # Adds salary to the dictionary\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sets**\n",
    "   - **Definition and Properties**:\n",
    "     - A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, created using curly braces or the `set()` function, e.g., `unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}`.\n",
    "     - Sets do not allow duplicate values, making them useful for removing duplicates from data.\n",
    "   - **Common Operations**:\n",
    "     - **Adding Elements**: Use `add()` to add a single element to a set.\n",
    "     - **Removing Elements**: Use `remove()` or `discard()` to delete elements.\n",
    "     - **Set Operations**: Perform union (`|`), intersection (`&`), and difference (`-`) operations, which are helpful in data comparison tasks.\n",
    "   - **Applications**:\n",
    "     - Sets are useful in data analysis when working with unique values or comparing datasets.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     ids = {101, 102, 103}\n",
    "     ids.add(104)  # Adds 104 to the set\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tuples**\n",
    "   - **Definition and Properties**:\n",
    "     - A tuple is an immutable sequence, created using parentheses, e.g., `coordinates = (10, 20)`.\n",
    "     - Since tuples cannot be changed, they are suitable for storing data that should remain constant.\n",
    "   - **Common Operations**:\n",
    "     - **Accessing Elements**: Use indexing like lists (e.g., `coordinates[0]`).\n",
    "     - **Unpacking**: You can unpack a tuple into multiple variables (e.g., `x, y = coordinates`).\n",
    "   - **Applications**:\n",
    "     - Tuples are often used for fixed collections, such as geographic coordinates, RGB color values, or other fixed data.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     point = (5, 10)\n",
    "     x, y = point  # Unpacking the tuple into x and y\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Iterating and Manipulating Data**\n",
    "   - **For Loops**:\n",
    "     - Learn to iterate over each data structure using `for` loops.\n",
    "     - **Example with List**: `for item in my_list: print(item)` loops through each item in `my_list`.\n",
    "   - **Comprehensions**:\n",
    "     - **List Comprehensions**: A concise way to create new lists from existing lists, e.g., `[x*2 for x in my_list]` creates a new list with each element doubled.\n",
    "     - **Dictionary Comprehensions**: Create new dictionaries, e.g., `{k: v*2 for k, v in my_dict.items()}`.\n",
    "   - **Filtering Data**:\n",
    "     - Filtering lists or dictionaries based on conditions.\n",
    "     - **Example**: `[x for x in my_list if x > 10]` returns a list of items greater than 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "- **Exercise 1**: Create a list of numbers, add a few elements, remove duplicates using a set, and iterate over the unique elements.\n",
    "- **Exercise 2**: Create a dictionary representing a personâ€™s profile, then add, update, and delete some entries.\n",
    "- **Exercise 3**: Create a tuple of coordinates and unpack it into separate variables.\n",
    "- **Exercise 4**: Practice list comprehensions by creating a list of squares from a range of numbers.\n"
